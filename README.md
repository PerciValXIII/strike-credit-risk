# STRIKE: A Feature-Group-Aware Stacking Framework for Credit Default Prediction

This repository contains the official implementation of **STRIKE**, introduced in our NeurIPS 2024 submission:  
**"STRIKE: Stacking via Targeted Representations of Isolated Knowledge Extractors."**

STRIKE is a modular stacking framework that enhances predictive performance by:
- Isolating semantically coherent **feature groups**,
- Training specialized **base models** on each group,
- Aggregating their predictions using a **logistic regression meta-learner**.

We provide scripts to reproduce results on three benchmark datasets:
- 🏢 Polish Company Bankruptcy Dataset (UCI)
- 💳 LendingClub Peer-to-Peer Loan Dataset (Kaggle)
- 🏠 Home Credit Default Risk Dataset (Kaggle)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerciValXIII/strike-credit-risk.git
cd strike-credit-risk
conda create -n strike python=3.10 -y
conda activate strike
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Reproducing Experiments

Each experiment is located under `src/` in its own subdirectory:

- `exp1_polish/`
- `exp2_lendingclub/`
- `exp3_homecredit/`

### Running STRIKE

Please refer to the `README.md` inside each experiment folder for exact commands.

Each script performs the following steps:
- Loads and preprocesses dataset 
- Constructs isolated feature groups
- Trains multiple base models with out-of-fold predictions
- Builds a meta-dataset
- Trains a logistic regression meta-model
