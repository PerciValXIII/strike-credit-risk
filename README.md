# STRIKE: A Feature-Group-Aware Stacking Framework for Credit Default Prediction

This repository contains the official implementation of the STRIKE framework proposed in the NeurIPS 2024 submission, **"STRIKE: Stacking via Targeted Representations of Isolated Knowledge Extractors"**. STRIKE is a modular stacking methodology that isolates semantically coherent feature groups, trains specialized base models per group, and combines their predictions through a meta-learner.

We provide scripts and configuration to replicate all experimental results on the following datasets:
- Polish Company Bankruptcy Dataset (UCI)
- LendingClub Peer-to-Peer Loan Dataset (Kaggle)
- Home Credit Default Risk Dataset (Kaggle)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerciValXIII/strike-credit-risk.git
cd strike-credit-risk
conda create -n strike python=3.10 -y
conda activate strike
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Reproduce Experiments

Each dataset experiment is contained in its own directory under `src/`.

### Run STRIKE on Polish Dataset

```bash
cd src/exp1_polish
python run_polish_strike.py
```

### Run STRIKE on LendingClub Dataset

```bash
cd src/exp2_lendingclub
python run_lendingclub_strike.py
```

### Run STRIKE on HomeCredit Dataset

```bash
cd src/exp3_homecredit
python run_homecredit_strike.py
```

Each script will:
- Load the corresponding dataset from `data/`
- Apply feature group isolation
- Train baseline models with out-of-fold prediction
- Construct the meta-dataset
- Train the final logistic regression meta-learner
- Output logs, trained models, and predictions to `outputs/`

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

The primary evaluation metric is **AUC-ROC**. For all experiments:
- A 70/30 train-test split is used
- 5-fold cross-validation is applied within the training set
- OOF predictions are used to construct the meta-dataset
- All results are reproducible and stored under `outputs/`
